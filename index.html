<p>This program is a workout generator based on your play from your previous games! It allows you to take your recent match information and see how you stacked up against the others in your match and then generates how many Pushups/Situps/Squats you do based on this information!</p>

<p>This was a sideproject for <a href="https://github.com/Detayl" class="user-mention">@Detayl</a> and continues to be something for him to do on the side, so if there are bugs and things that could be changed feel free to let him know.</p>

<p>Ultimately, join us all in getting fit with League of Legends</p>
